# Report of Milestone 4

There are 2 major issues to be solved in this milestone: 

1. Responsiveness Issue: 
    In order to improve the game's responsiveness, we let the player's input
(controlling his/her paddle) be updated to the local game state immediately, 
and send the effective coordinate of the paddle every frame. (The game running
as 60fps.) In this case, the client program does not need to read the coordinate
of the current player's paddle which sent back from the server, so jump-back
problem will not happen. 

2. Smoothness Issue: 
    The client's refresh rate is 6 times tickrate of the server, so we equally
break down every movement of the ball into 6 parts and update it separately in
6 frames. For the other players' (other than the current player) paddles, we use
the same mechanism, but the only difference is that the ball will predict the
following movements using the same speed if the client does not receive the
message on time, while the paddles will not because we do not want to predict the
other players' actions. As a result, the game is able to run quite smoothly with
low server tickrate and somewhat high latency.
